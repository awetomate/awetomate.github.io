[{"content":"Well, thanks for the interest, truly, but if you are here then we probably are very much alike.\nSoooo, no big surprises here\u0026hellip;\nI\u0026rsquo;m John and I\u0026rsquo;ve worked as both network and voice (UC) engineer my entire career and always for large(r) multinational enterprises. About 1-2 years ago I decided to start moving into the network automation space. So, I started off with learning some Python and scripting some of my daily tasks instead of doing them manually. I also got the Cisco DevNet Associate cert and am working now on the DevNet Professional cert. There is a lot to learn still and the goal is to become an network automation engineer as opposed to a network engineer who writes a bunch of scripts.\nSo, why this blog then? Fair question. I guess I just want to share. There were many times in my career when I was stuck with a problem and then stumbled upon a blog entry of a fellow engineer who had been facing the very same challenge and then decided to share the solution and therefore saved me from a lot of headache. And I hope that the information I share on this website will be helpful to someone else out there on the interwebs.\n","date":"3 October 2022","permalink":"/about/","section":"Awetomate","summary":"Well, thanks for the interest, truly, but if you are here then we probably are very much alike.\nSoooo, no big surprises here\u0026hellip;\nI\u0026rsquo;m John and I\u0026rsquo;ve worked as both network and voice (UC) engineer my entire career and always for large(r) multinational enterprises.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/","section":"Awetomate","summary":"","title":"Awetomate"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/categories/cucm/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"cucm"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/tags/tag1/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"tag1"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/categories/test/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"test"},{"content":"Test One # Just a test post to verify functionality.\nprint(\u0026#34;Hello, world!\u0026#34;) for i in range(10): print(i) ","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/2022/10/test-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Test One # Just a test post to verify functionality.\nprint(\u0026#34;Hello, world!\u0026#34;) for i in range(10): print(i) ","title":"Test Post"}]
