[{"content":"Well, thanks for the interest, truly, but if you are here, we probably are much alike or have similar interests.\nSoooo, no big surprises here…\nI’m John, and I’ve worked as both network and voice (UC) engineer my entire career and always for large(r) multinational enterprises. About 1-2 years ago, I decided that I wanted to move into the network automation space. So, I started by learning some Python and scripting some of my daily tasks instead of doing them manually. I also got the Cisco DevNet Associate cert and am working now on the DevNet Professional cert - because it’s always good to have some certs. There is a lot to learn still, and the goal is to become a proper network automation engineer, as opposed to a network engineer who writes a bunch of scripts.\nSo, why this blog then? Fair question. I guess I just want to share. Many times in my career, I was stuck with a problem, hitting a wall, and then stumbled upon a blog entry of a fellow engineer who had been facing the same challenge and decided to share the solution, saving me from a lot of headaches. I hope the information I share on this website will be helpful to someone else out there on the interwebs and safes them from unnecessary headaches, too.\n","date":"3 October 2022","permalink":"/about/","section":"Awetomate","summary":"Well, thanks for the interest, truly, but if you are here, we probably are much alike or have similar interests.\nSoooo, no big surprises here…\nI’m John, and I’ve worked as both network and voice (UC) engineer my entire career and always for large(r) multinational enterprises.","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/","section":"Awetomate","summary":"","title":"Awetomate"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/categories/cucm/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"cucm"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/tags/tag1/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"tag1"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/categories/test/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"test"},{"content":"Test One # Just a test post to verify functionality.\nprint(\u0026#34;Hello, world!\u0026#34;) for i in range(10): print(i) ","date":"2 October 2022","permalink":"/2022/10/test-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Test One # Just a test post to verify functionality.\nprint(\u0026#34;Hello, world!\u0026#34;) for i in range(10): print(i) ","title":"Test Post"}]
